<title>Scatter Demos</title>

<h1>Scatter Demos</h1>
<p>Scatter is designed to be simple yet versatile. The demos provided here
show how features can be used together and what can be achieved.

<p>The demos use a mix of Scatter options with custom CSS and JavaScript to
provide the different effects - this is the way Scatter is designed to work:
as a solid core of functionality from which you pick and choose whatever
is needed to create the effect you are after.

<ul>
	<li><a href="./polaroids.html">Polaroids</a> - all options default, using CSS to style items as polaroid photos with captions.
	<li><a href="./slides.html">Slides</a> - shows grid mode, limiting rotation, and using next/prev navigation functions.
	<li><a href="./mobile.html">Mobile</a> - gives an example of how to detect swipe left/right to trigger navigation.
	<li><a href="./cards.html">Cards</a> - shows random mode and overriding the transform style to flip cards.
	<li><a href="./stars.html">Stars</a> - uses fixed mode with predefined positions to transition through constellations.
</ul>

<p>All of the demos are self-contained - none of them use any additional resources beyond scatter.js,
and the entire demo code for each one is available by using View Source.
